# LTS-Accuracy-Enhancement-Project
Welcome to the Lip to Speech Synthesis project by Varcons Technologies Pvt Ltd! This project focuses on developing and testing Lip to Speech (LTS) synthesis technology. Our primary objective is to enhance communication accessibility through innovative technology. While we didn't create this project from scratch, we've been entrusted with evaluating and refining its accuracy.
The project is built using Python and Flask framework for web development. It utilizes the Wav2Vec2 model from the Hugging Face Transformers library for speech recognition tasks.
